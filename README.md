# EEG GAN Project repository
In this branch the EEG GAN project is reworked using torch lightning. The code is a continuation of the EEG GAN project from Kay Hartmann.
The original code can be found here: https://github.com/kahartma/eeggan.git

IMPORTANT: to run the code, we recommend to first create an virtual environment and install the requirements from the environment.yml file.
secondly the current project needs to be installed as a package. This can be done by running the following command in the root directory of the project:
``` pip install -e . ```
Note the dot at the end of the command and don't forget to activate the virtual environment before running the command.
